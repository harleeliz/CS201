DESCRIPTION

PART 1.
* The Jacobsthal numbers are those derived by the Uns in the Lucas sequence with P = 1 and Q = 2, which equate to a = 2 and b = -1.
The presented code will compute the n-th Jacobsthal number using recursive and iterative methods.
Both approaches will be compared based on the execution time of the methods defined in the JacobsthalCalculator class. 
In addition, two printer methods in the class JacobsthalCalculator were added to properly display each iteration on the main class.
 
 
 PART 2.
 *This java application will system.out.print the maximum value of a declared unsorted array.
