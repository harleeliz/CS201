DESCRIPTION
This Java application implements the selection sort algorithm on a randomly produced array of integers; the default range of integers is 0 to 10 000, and the quantity to generate is 10,000. 

The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly identifying the smallest member in the unsorted region of the array and placing it at the start. This operation will continue until the full array is sorted. This algorithm's Java implementation ensures that the resulting integer array is randomly mixed prior to performing the selection sort.
