DESCRIPTION
This Java application compares and sorts Student objects based on user input. The Student class has private fields for student names and identification numbers, and a static Comparator object, InfoComparator, used to compare two objects. The main method creates an ArrayList and uses a Scanner to take user input. The sorted list is then printed to the console. The application currently supports two student comparisons, and adjusting code for more students may be necessary.
